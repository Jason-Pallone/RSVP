![RSVP site gif](/RSVP/public/rsvp-gif.gif)

This is an RSVP site created with React.

You can add a guest, edit the guest, remove the guest and confirm them. There is a phantom li element that shows the input value while you type, it is removed on submit. There is an option to filter the guests to view only the guests that have confirmed they will attend. The intro message disappears on submit of the first li, if you remove all li, the intro message returns.
